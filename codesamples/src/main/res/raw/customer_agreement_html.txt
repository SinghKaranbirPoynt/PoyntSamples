If you do not agree to such automatically requested and received Updates then please do not use the Store.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.3. How does the Store work?</strong></p>
<p>The Store is an online platform or marketplace where Content providers and Merchants arrange for offering, purchasing and licensing of Content directly with each other. Such Content is included in the Store by the Content providers and the license, purchase, subscription or acquisition of the Content is governed by separate terms and conditions as may be determined by each of the relevant Content provider in a separate agreement.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE STORE IS INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE CONTENT PROVIDERS' AND MERCHANTS' CONNECTING AND TRANSACTING DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. POYNT DOES NOT ENDORSE ANY CONTENT. POYNT CANNOT CONTROL, AND DOES NOT CONTROL ANY CONTENT AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY CONTENT. POYNT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE STORE. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION, COMPLAINT OR ISSUE IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTENT PURCHASED OR LICENSED THROUGH THE STORE, PLEASE CONTACT THE RELEVANT CONTENT PROVIDER DIRECTLY.</p>
<p><strong>2.4. Orders, Fees and Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Your access to the Store is free of charge. However, you may download and access Content free of charge or upon payment of a fee, as determined solely by the provider of the relevant Content. In case of the latter, Content providers may charge a recurring subscription fee, so please carefully review the terms and the financial conditions applicable to each Content you intend to download (especially in relation to the type of payment that will be performed).</p>
<p>When Content is offered for a fee, purchase of such Content will be subject to specific terms from the respective Content provider applicable for the relevant Content and to approval of the relevant payment, in addition to these Terms. At that time, Content provider, through Poynt or other collecting agent appointed by the Content provider, will capture payment on the payment instrument you provided and then authorize the download of the Content. We or the relevant collecting agent may obtain an additional authorization from your payment instrument to confirm if necessary funds are available for payment of the relevant fees.</p>
<p>Poynt or the relevant collecting agent appointed by Poynt may attempt to contact you if all or a portion of your order is cancelled, or if additional information is needed to complete and accept your order for Content. For any order portion Content provider, or Poynt or collecting agent on behalf of Content provider, cancels, you will receive a refund of the price and taxes you paid for that order portion less the value of any promotional merchandise or discount you received.</p>
<p>Fees for Content may be subject to change at any time without notice or otherwise stipulated in terms and conditions for use of the Content, at the Content provider's discretion.</p>
<p>Poynt may add or remove payment methods at its sole discretion and without notice to you.</p>
<p>If Poynt or the relevant collecting agent appointed by Poynt requires any information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument in order to process payment of fees for Content on behalf of Content provider, you represent and warrant to Poynt that such information is true and that you are authorized to use such payment instrument. You hereby authorize Poynt or the relevant collecting agent appointed by Poynt to bill your payment instrument in accordance with the Content you are acquiring. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Content you acquire.</p>
<p>Each Content provider may appointed Poynt as the Content providers&rsquo; limited payment collection agent solely for the purposes of accepting fees from Merchants for Content licensed and/or purchased on the Store. Each Content provider agrees that payments made by a Merchant through Poynt, or the relevant collecting agent shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Content provider, and the Content provider will make the Content available to the Merchant in the agreed-upon manner.</p>
<p><strong>2.5. General Store rules</strong></p>
<p>You will only access and use the Store for your own internal use and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your access to and use of the Store is prohibited by applicable laws, then you are not authorized to access and use the Store. We cannot and will not be responsible for your accessing and using the Store in a way that breaks the law.</p>
<p>You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password. You are responsible for any activity associated with your account.</p>

At the Content provider's instructions, Poynt may refuse or reject any order at any time, and Poynt or the collecting agent appointed by Content provider will refund you any monies you have paid for the order, for reasons which include, but are not limited to, if you have not met the conditions specified at the time of the order, if your payment cannot be processed, if the ordered Content is not available, or for errors on the Store or made in connection with your order or unavailability or issues in the performance of the Store. In the event of errors on the Store or made in connection with your order, we reserve the right to correct the error and charge you the correct price. In that situation, we may contact you and offer you the option of purchasing the Content at the correct price or canceling your order. Credits or refunds will be made to the same method of payment and account used to place the order and if this is not feasible, Poynt or the collecting agent appointed by Poynt will contact you to agree on another payment method. Content may be removed from the Store at the discretion of Content provider, if required by applicable law, governmental authority or a valid court order, or if Poynt reasonably believes that the Content violates any applicable terms related to the Store or applicable laws.</p>
